Waveform Sampler iOS 
===============

Introduction
===============
Welcome to the Waveform Sampler Documentation! This iOS app consists of four buttons that allow you to sample four of your favorite songs and select parts of the waveform to sample. You can select the songs to sample in the second view. Unfortunately, you cannot pull from your iPhone music library at this time and the waveform selection due to the time constraints. I hope to finish this in the near future when time permits.

Known Errors:
===============
-Built for iOS 6.0
 Has not been updated to iOS 7.0 standards yet

-AudioFileRead buffer is not set up correctly
